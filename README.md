# A-New-Programming-Language
Meet AYVA++ , a programming language designed by us for mathematical set operations! 

We firstly defined our grammer in Backus-Naur form, you can see it in the PDF File. The syntax is defined by using the lexical analyzer Lex Tool. Following, we build the parser by using Yacc Tool. The produced makefile by Dijkstra machine of Bilkent University is also in the repository.

Group Members :
Recep UYSAL and Mehmet Alper ÇETİN.

This project is assigned by Prof. Dr. Halil Altay Güvenir. We would also like to thank to Ms. Irmak Türköz, our teaching assistant, for her help and consultation.
